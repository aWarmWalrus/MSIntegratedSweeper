MSIntegratedSweeper
===================
The implementation of minesweeper I used to test
the logic was a Javascript implementation that can
be found on minesweeperonline.com

For dumb-bot, my fastest time is 4s (I currently 
hold the all-time record for intermediate) and
the win-rate is around 22%. Dumb-bot uses very
basic logic, not considering mine count. It will
merely see for which blocks it is impossible to
have a mine, but in cases where it is not 
straightforward to determine where the mine is,
it simply gives up and tries again.
